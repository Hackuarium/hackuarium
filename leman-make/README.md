## Leman make 2018

We could offer goodies during the Leman and the idea is that it is
a laser cut box.

We have 4 stands and we could have 4 different boxes. They
would have slightly different shapes but all of the would have
a QRcode on the back of the box with a link to the project.

In each folder there is a dxf of the box as well as a logo or
QRcode.

The 4 projects are:

- Octanis
- Beemos
- Hackuarium
- Simple spectro
